# Axoni Tech Application 
## Production

Unfortunately, the LastFM API no longer provides pictures for artists, and only provide a blank picture with a star, which is what I have rendering. 
Made using React
You can download the application and install it locally:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lennox-davidlevy/axoni_lastfm.git
$ cd axoni_lastfm
$ npm install
```

## ADD LastFM API KEY
Please go to root/.env and replace "ENTER LASTFM API KEY HERE" with the API key provided to me for this application to work!

## And then just run it!

```
$ npm start
```
